# weight-tracking-app
Weight tracking Android app developed as part of CS 360 mobile application development.

The mobile application developed for this course was designed to help users track their weight over time in a simple and accessible way. The primary goal of the app was to allow users to enter weight values, store them reliably, and view their progress without unnecessary complexity. This app was built to address the need for a straightforward health-tracking tool that prioritizes ease of use, clear data presentation, and consistent data storage.

To support these user needs, several key screens and features were implemented. These included screens for entering weight data, viewing saved entries, and navigating between different sections of the app. The user interface was intentionally kept clean and minimal to reduce friction during daily use. UI design decisions focused on clarity, readable text, logical navigation, and minimizing the number of steps required to complete common actions. By keeping the design simple and consistent, the app supports a user-centered experience that avoids overwhelming the user with unnecessary options or visual clutter.

The coding process for this application followed an incremental and structured approach. Rather than attempting to build the entire app at once, functionality was developed in smaller sections and tested as each feature was added. This strategy made it easier to identify issues early and ensured that core features were stable before expanding the app further. Techniques such as modular development, frequent testing, and validating assumptions about app behavior helped create a more reliable final product. These same strategies can be applied to future projects to improve efficiency and reduce development errors.

Testing played a key role in ensuring the application functioned as intended. Features were tested regularly during development to confirm correct data storage, screen navigation, and input handling. This process helped reveal issues related to database usage, app state, and user input validation that may not have been obvious without hands-on testing. Regular testing was essential in maintaining app stability and highlighted the importance of verifying functionality before moving on to additional features.

Throughout the full design and development process, innovation was required to overcome several challenges, particularly in managing data persistence and ensuring smooth interaction between the user interface and the database. Adjustments to design decisions and implementation strategies were necessary to ensure data was stored accurately and displayed consistently. These challenges reinforced the importance of adaptability and problem-solving in mobile app development.

One area where I was particularly successful in demonstrating my skills was in integrating database functionality with the user interface. Ensuring that user input was properly stored, retrieved, and displayed required a strong understanding of Android development concepts and careful attention to detail. This component of the app reflects both my technical growth throughout the course and my ability to apply user-centered design principles in a functional mobile application.
